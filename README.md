# Drink

### by Midori Bowen, Kyle Langley, Will Murphy, & Jeffrey Ruder

Drink uses the [Absolut Drinks API](http://addb.absolutdrinks.com) to allow users to search for cocktail recipes, add them to a shopping-cart-like Ember service, and calculate the total amount of ingredients to purchase based on number of party guests.

It demonstrates routing and the use of services and computed properties in Ember.
